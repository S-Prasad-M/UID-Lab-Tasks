                        Physics is the study of matter â€” what is it made of? How does it behave? What laws or equations describe it? From subatomic particles, to the Big Bang, modern physicists study matter at a tremendous range of scales. There's a whole lot of interesting physics at the human scale, too

                    An experienced chemistry professor used to say that it took about one explosion per week to maintain college students' attention in chemistry lectures. At that rate, we'd get in pretty big trouble with a lot of parents and teachers! Don't worry, we still have lots of bubbles, fizzes, bangs, and color changes for you to explore

                    Isn't the human body incredible? From the complex systems that make it work to the numerous ways we're able to cure illnesses, there are so many fascinating subjects to study when it comes to human biology and health. Are you interested in subjects like how the body works, how best to keep it working, and how to cure everything from a common cough to cancer?
